# Snake Game in C
This Snake Game Project is a basic console program with no graphics, implemented entirely in C language. <br/>
It features a strong understanding of the C language and deep knowledge of pointers. <br/>

# How to Play
To control the snake, use the following keys: <br/>

- Up: 'up arrow'  <br/>
- Down: 'down arrow'  <br/>
- Right: 'right arrow'  <br/>
- Left: 'left arrow'  <br/>
- Quit: 'q'  <br/>
Food is randomly placed on the screen, and each time the snake eats it, its length and score increase by one.  <br/>

# Installation
To download and run the project, clone the repository to your computer. The repository includes the following projects:  <br/>

Snake_Lib: Implementation of the game functions, set as library project.  <br/>
Snake_runner: Start project.  <br/>
Snake_UnitTest: Tests all functions to ensure everything is working correctly.  <br/>
To run the project, simply compile and execute the Snake_runner project.  <br/>

# Screenshots
Added a screen shot of the game in action:

# Code Only
If you only want the Snake code file (cpp), it is available in the "snake code only" folder.  <br/>
You can download and add it to your project as needed.  <br/>
